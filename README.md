# Rupp_etal_Anole_DosageCompensation
This repository contains scripts and information related to the genetic diversity analyses in Rupp et al (_In review_). Evolution of dosage compensation in _Anolis carolinensis_, a reptile with XX/XY chromosomal sex determination.

#Data and samples

The samples for this study consist of RNA-seq data from five biological replicates of regenerating tail tissue each from two male (d15 and d26) and two female (d47 and d61) green anoles (_Anolis carolinensis_) from [Hutchins et al (2014)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105004).  Further details on the collection, sequencing, and processing of data can be found in [Hutchins et al (2014)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105004)
